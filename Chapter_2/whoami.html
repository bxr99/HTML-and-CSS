    <h1>whoami</h1>
    <p>My name is Eli.  I am a college student at the <cite>University of Maryland</cite>.  I
    am currently a Computer Science major within the
    <abbr title="College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences"><i>CMNS</i></abbr>.</p>
    <p>While the school uses Java and C in the computer science curriculum, I still seek to understand
    other languages such as C++, HTML, and CSS.</p>
