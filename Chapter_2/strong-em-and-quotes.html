	<h2>The strong Tag</h2>
	<p>The use of the strong tag indicates that its content is important.
	  By default browsers will show the contents between a strong element as bold.</p>
	<h2>The em Tag</h2>
	<p>The use of the em tag indicates emphasis (obviously..) of certain text.
	  By default browsers will show the contents between a em element in <em>italics</em>.
	</p>
	<h2>The blockquote and q Tag</h2>
	<p>blockquote and q tags are the two commonly used elements for marking up quotations.
	  The blockquote is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph.
	  The q tag is used for shorterr quotes that sit within a paragraph.  Like 
	  the founding fathers once said, <q>Ball is life.</q></p>
	  <blockquote>Here I am using blockquote tags, note that when using this element
	  	that browsers tend to indent the contents automatically.  This tag should
	  	not be used to indent, CSS is to be the preferred choice</blockquote>
