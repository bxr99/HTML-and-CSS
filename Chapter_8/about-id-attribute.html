	<h2>The Reality of Life For Most People</h2>
	<p>A quote that I found strong meaning in, even though it was from a movie was:
		<!-- The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element -->
		<!-- No two elements on the same page have the same value for their id (otherwise the value is no longer unique) -->
		<!-- Giving an element a unique identity allows you to style it differently from any other instance of the same element on the page -->
